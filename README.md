# Smile
### Put your happiness in the cloud.

Share your moments of joy with the world! 
- Just press the button when you're happy. 
- Record your happy moments of the day.
- Look at a map of other people being happy. 
- Keep smiling! :)

My first venture into mobile development. Used [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) and [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/) to build an app to make you smile.
